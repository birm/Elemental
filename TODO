Each of the following categories lists goals in an order which roughly 
corresponds to the order in which they are hoped to be added.
Items are marked using the following code:
  [x] ~ planned to be finished before the next release 
  [o] ~ hopefully started in the near future 
  [-] ~ marked for eventual development

    buffers in (Dist)Matrix
[-] Axpy interface implementation using one-sided communication
[-] Square process grid specializations of LDL and Bunch-Kaufman
[-] Businger-esque element-growth monitoring in GEPP and Bunch-Kaufman

[o] Support for BLIS and fused Trmv's to accelerate HermitianEig
[-] Optimized version of ApplySymmetricPivots
[-] Exploit structure in matrix sign based control solvers

Maintenance priorities
======================

Bug avoidance
-------------

Instrumentation/visualization/testing
-------------------------------------
[-] Global command-line options which are automatic for every driver, e.g.,
    "--colMajor <true/false>" for column-major process grids and 
    "--nb <blocksize>" for the algorithmic blocksize
[-] Means of easily tracking/plotting heap memory usage over time
[-] Provide way to zoom in/out and add colorbar to DisplayWidget
[-] Better organization of test matrices into relevant classes, e.g., Hermitian,
    normal, triangular, Hessenberg, etc., so that each test driver can easily
    test each member from that class.

Consistency/modularity
----------------------
[-] Modify Grid to return communicators based upon the distribution, e.g., 
    Comm(VC)?
[-] Extract BLAS/LAPACK/MPI wrappers into a separate project
[-] Make transpose-options of LocalTrr(2)k more consistent with Trr(2)k
[-] Consistent implementation of unblocked routines
[-] Safe down-casting of integers in BLAS/LAPACK calls

External Interfaces
-------------------
[o] Expose BlockDistMatrix to C and Python (as well as ScaLAPACK interface)

Build system
------------
[o] Attempt to shorten build via extern templates

MPI and Threading
-----------------
[-] Implement message-splitting in collectives for count > 2^31
[-] Use MPI contiguous datatype for all messages with count > 2^31 
    (may not work with older MPIs)
[-] Detect oversubsription using sysconf/sysctl and {OMP,MKL,*}_NUM_THREADS
[-] Add MPI wrappers for all nonblocking collectives
[-] Add MPI wrappers for RMA
